Just like what the description says, this program allows users to have anonymous conversations with strangers in real time. 

This program does not have a database functionality, therefore chat messages are not stored and are lost after a user leaves the room. This also means that users do not have to register for an account and can just enter any room with any username. Lastly, the current state of the program allows it to only be used locally, but its code can be easily modified to run on the internet (After uploading it to a hosting platform).

To run the program, run cmd in the root folder and then type "node server.js"
After it says that the server is running, go to any browser and type "localhost:3000"
